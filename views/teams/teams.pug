    | With the Teams API, you can obtain information from a collection of teams simultaneously. The teams collection is qualified in the URI by a particular league to obtain information about teams within the league, or by a particular user (and optionally, a game) to obtain information about the teams owned by the user. Each element beneath the Teams Collection will be a Team Resource.
