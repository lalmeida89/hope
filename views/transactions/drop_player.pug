block description
  p
    | To drop a player from a team you must specify the league, team and player keys, respectively.
  p
    | Currently, we can only drop 1 player at a time, but I will update the library to support multiple drops in the near future!
  p 
    | You must be authenticated as the team owner drop players from a team. It would appear being league commissioner does not allow you to override this.
