block description
  p
    | To drop a player from a team you must specify the league, team and player keys who you are adding / dropping, respectively.
  p
    | Currently, we can only add/drop 1 player at a time, but I will update the library to support multiple add/drops in the near future!
  p 
    | You must be authenticated as the team owner to perform this action. It would appear being league commissioner does not allow you to override this.
