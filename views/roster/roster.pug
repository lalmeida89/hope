    | Players on a team are organized into rosters corresponding to certain weeks, in NFL, or certain dates, in MLB, NBA, and NHL. Each player on a roster will be assigned a position if they're in the starting lineup, or will be on the bench. You can only receive credit for stats accumulated by players in your starting lineup.

    | Eventually the PUT functionality may be added.
