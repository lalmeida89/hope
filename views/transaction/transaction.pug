    | With the Transaction API, you can obtain information about transactions (adds, drops, trades, and league settings changes) performed on a league. A transaction is identified in the context of a particular league, although you can request a particular Transaction Resource as the base of your URI by using the global transaction_key.
  p
    | maps to https://fantasysports.yahooapis.com/fantasy/v2/transaction/{transaction_key}/{sub_resource}

block description
  p
    | Includes transaction key, id, type, timestamp, status, and players. For the purpose of this API, the players subresource is always called so players always come back by default
  p
    | Keep in mind, if you don't have the transaction_key for a waiver claim or pending trade, the only way to discover these transactions is to filter the league <a href="/collection/transactions/leagueFetch">Transactions collection</a> by a particular type (waiver or pending_trade) and by a particular team_key. Pending transactions will not show up if you simply ask for all of the transactions in the league, because they can only be seen by certain teams.
  p
    | At the moment, only "transactions" types are supported. Waiver claims and pending trades will soon be added.
  p
    | In the future, I hope to support more than just the GET requests, but for the time being, they should be fine.
